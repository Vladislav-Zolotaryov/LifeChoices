# Without Managed Services
* Contabo - Cheapest and robust solution (4 vCPU Cores, 8 GB Ram, 5.5$/month)
* Hetzner - Good all-rounder with lots of features and medium prices (1 vCPU, 2 GB Ram 5$/month)

# With Managed Services
* Vultr - Managed services, VPC peering, good pricing (1 vCPU, 1 GB Ram 5$/month)
* Linode/Akamai - Managed services, VPC peering, good pricing (1 vCPU, 1 GB Ram 5$/month)
* DigitalOcean -  Managed services, VPC peering, above average pricing (1 vCPU, 1 GB Ram 6$/month)

# Big 3
* GCP - Robust, well priced for VPS, has unique solutions such as CloudSpanner for global databases (2 vCPU, 1 GB Ram 6$/month)
* AWS - Pricy but probably the best solution if you need multi-region (2 vCPU, 1 GB Ram 7$/month)
* Azure - Microsoft ... Average pricing just between AWS and GCP price brackets (2 vCPU, 1 GB Ram 30$/month)

# PaaS
* Heroku - Need to investigate more

# Storage
* pCloud - Good personal storage with lifetime plans and clients for any platform


Need to setup more cost calculation scenarios.
 * Reserved instances
 * On Demand Pricing with Bursting Traffic
 * On Demand Pricing with 50% utilization during a month
 * Autoscaling capabilities (and limitations) and money saving
 * Managed vs Self Provisioned DB setups
 * Cost of VPC peering
 * Cost of Object storage
 * Cost of GPU (best price for ML/AI/LLM)
