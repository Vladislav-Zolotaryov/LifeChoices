Clients for HTTP testing
* Postman - refresh tokens don't play along well with oAuth, GUI only, a bit bloaty
* cUrl - CLI only and inhumane API
* hurl - HTTP requests described in plan text files, similiar to JetBrains HTTP Client
* httpie - CLI + GUI, mature, open source
* xh - attemp at httpie, but faster, less mature, lacks features
